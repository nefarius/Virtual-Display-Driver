## â„¹ About

This project is based on the "Virtual Display Driver" project and tries to improve on it.

> based on Microsoft Indirect Display Driver Sample. This creates a virtual display in Windows that acts and functions just like a real one. It's useful for streaming, virtual reality applications, recording, headless servers, etc. The benefit over a physical display is the ability to adjust resolutions and refresh rates beyond the physical displays capabilities. For example, this would enable the ability to stream a game from your home PC using game streaming software at 240hz at 8K while owning a 60hz 1080p monitor (unrealistic, but explains the abilities well). For servers without displays, this enabled remote desktop and screen streaming to other systems as if there were a display installed. 

> Supports emulating resolutions from **640 x 480** to **7680 x 4320 (8K)**, and refresh rates including **60hz, 75hz, 90hz, 120hz, 144hz, 165hz, 240hz, 480hz,** and **500hz.**

> This project uses the official Windows Indirect Display Driver combined with the IddCx class extension driver.

This project adds an easy to follow setup wizard and installer to install your Virtual Display. The setup wizard also lets you specify how many displays you want to add to your system without having to change any config file yourself.
  
I hope you enjoy this project and if you do i would appreciate a star rating :-)
